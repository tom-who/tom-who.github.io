    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <br><p>I have experience in coding (this website obviously) but also in python, C++ and bash.
    On the <a href="../home">home</a> page I have linked to my bash script I use for recon on bug bounty programs or VDPs.<br>This script has helped me find exploits like XSS, open redirect, authentication bypass and 0 click ATO.<br> I also like to make content online about CTF's I do on TryHackMe or from sources like vulnhub. You can find my medium <a href="https://medium.com/@tom.sh">here.</a> I try to make as much content as I can given school and other projects I want to do, and I like to explain in great detail, as when I first began I didn't understand alot of hacking articles etc. My favourite CTF has to be around the time of Christmas 2023, during TryHackMe's AoC they did side quests for more experienced hackers. These were the most difficult but fun challenges I've ever done, I'm very excited for them to do it again this year.<br>Speaking of TryHackMe, one of my best accomplishments has been reaching top 1% of users on there, at the time of writing I'm rank 3268 out of roughly 3,000,000. And I am rank 20 in my country of all time.<br>My goals to reach by the end of 2024 is to break into top 2000 on TryHackMe, begin development of a game on  unity, recieve bug bounty payment to set up a home lab and make more content.<br><br>If you want to contact me for business or anything like that you can find my email on the homepage, or just <a href="mailto:tomhtml@bugcrowdninja.com">click this link</a></p>
